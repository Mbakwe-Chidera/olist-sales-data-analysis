Examining, generating insights from, and visualizing Olist E-commerce sales data

##Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce website that links clients all across Brazil to small and medium-sized businesses. The platform functions as an online marketplace where businesses may post their goods and services for clients to browse and buy. The orders placed on the Olist between September 2016 and September 2018 are included in the Olist sales dataset, which is a compilation of anonymized information.

#A data analysis project that examines the Olist platform's sales data and offers insights into revenue trends, order patterns, product categories, seller performance, consumer behavior, and payment methods is housed in this repository. Python is used to carry out the project, together with Jupyter notebooks, and a number of data science packages.

#By responding to the following business queries, we hope to aid Olist in better understanding their e-commerce platform and maximizing their potential for growth:

1. What is the total revenue generated by Olist, and how has it changed over time?
2. How many orders were placed on Olist, and how does this vary by month?
3. What are the most popular product categories on Olist, and how do their sales volumes compare to each other?
4. What is the average order value (AOV) on Olist, and how does this vary by product category and payment method?
5. Who are the top active sellers on Olist?
6. What is the distribution of seller ratings on Olist, and how does this impact sales performance?
7. How many customers have made repeat purchases on Olist, and what percentage of total sales do they account for?
8. What is the average customer rating for products sold on Olist, and how does this impact sales performance?

10. Which payment methods are most commonly used by Olist customers?
11. Which product categories have the highest revenue on Olist, and how can the company increase revenue across different categories?
